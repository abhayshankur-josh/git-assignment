Q. Under what conditions will Git consider a file that has been deleted as being renamed, and what criteria does Git use to determine that a new file is a renamed version of the deleted file?
A. Git might treat a deleted file as a renamed one if the content of a new file is similar to the one that was deleted. Git uses a similarity threshold (usually 50%) to decide whether a new file is a renamed version of the deleted file. If the content of the new file closely matches the deleted one, Git will infer that the file was renamed, not deleted.
